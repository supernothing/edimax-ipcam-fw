This project provides tools to extract, modify, and rebuild valid Edimax IP camera firmware images. This allows users to mitigate unpatched security issues with the cameras, as well as put custom scripts and applications onto the device.

Disclaimer: flashing your firmware is inherently risky. If something breaks, you're on your own.
