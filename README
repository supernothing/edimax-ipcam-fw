To begin modifying your firmware, you must first compile (or, alternatively, install)
the appropriate tools. Do the following:

cd squashfs-3.0/
./configure
make
cd ../tools/
gcc AppendChecksum.c -o AppendChecksum

Now your extract/build environment should be ready.

To extract firmware, simply run ./extract_image.sh IMAGE DEST_PATH

This will create three directories in your DEST_PATH: original_images,
squashfs_root, and temp_files. Generally, you will only need to modify
squashfs_root. This is your root filesystem. Place/modify any files you
wish here, and they will be compiled into the final image.

If you need to compile applications for the camera, a cross compilation toolchain
provided by Edimax can be found in the tools/ directory.

To rebuild after making changes, simply run ./build_image.sh SRC_PATH DST_IMAGE

Then, simply flash the device as you normally would.

WARNING: Flashing is inherently dangerous. I am not responsible if you brick
your camera. These tools have worked well for me, but I offer no guarantees.
